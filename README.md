# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-ProjectCOVID-19 Global Data Tracker
📌 Project Description

This project is a data analysis and visualization notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time. Learners will clean and process real-world data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), generate insights, and visualize trends using Python data tools.

By the end of the project, you'll have a comprehensive data report with visuals and narrative insights, suitable for presentation or publishing.

🎯 Project Objectives

✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

💡 Insights & Reflections
Countries with early vaccination rollouts saw a faster decline in new cases.
Death rates varied significantly across regions.
Some countries had data inconsistencies or gaps, highlighting the importance of data cleaning.
